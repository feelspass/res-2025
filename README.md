# Instructions: Submit Your Mini Project via GitHub Pull Request

In this exercise, you will fork the course repository, add your completed mini project (Overleaf paper + Inkscape figure), and submit a **Pull Request (PR)** to a branch in the main repository named after you. This allows me to review your work and keeps the main repository organized.

## 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to the course repository: [[res-2025] ](https://github.com/lisawink/res-2025) 
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top right.  
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## 2. Clone Your Fork Locally
